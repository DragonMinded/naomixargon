# Xargon for Sega Naomi

This is a port of the released source code for Xargon Episodes 1-3 for the Sega Naomi platform. If you want
to compile it, you will need to first set up the libnaomi toolchain at https://github.com/DragonMinded/libnaomi.
The original game files were also released as freeware so they are included in the release of Xargon for
Sega Naomi! Much thanks to Allen Pilgrim for releasing all of this and allowing me to play one of my favorite
games as a kid on a whole new platform!

Note that this is neither designed for, nor will ever be coded to take coin drops. This is a hobby port and
I don't want people making money running this in public based on my hard work. Somebody else may do the work
to make this happen, but I certainly won't be that person!

## Releases

Currently there is no binary release for Xargon. Stay tuned for the future when this will change!
